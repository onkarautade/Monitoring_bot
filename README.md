## ðŸ›  Development & Future Improvements

This project was developed with the assistance of **large language models** and **code-completion tools**, including *ChatGPT*, *Gemini*, and *Copilot*.  
It represents an exploration of what can be accomplished with AI-assisted development.

### ðŸ’¡ Suggestions for Further Development

1. **Implement a Database Pruning Mechanism**  
   - The current system does not delete old records from the SQLite database.  
   - Without cleanup, the database will grow indefinitely, eventually consuming all available storage on the Raspberry Pi.  
   - **Recommendation**: Implement a periodic cleanup function.

2. **Refactor the Alerting System**  
   - The in-memory alert list (`stored_alerts` in `system_monitor.py`) is cleared after a single retrieval and is not persistent.  
   - **Recommendation**: Log all critical alerts to a persistent table for auditable history across reboots.

3. **Centralize Configuration**  
   - Configuration parameters like `DB_PATH` are hardcoded in multiple scripts.  
   - **Recommendation**: Consolidate all configuration variables into a single `.env` file for easier deployment and maintenance.

4. **Enhance Expert Mode Security**  
   - The `subprocess.run(shell=True)` call in `bot.py` is a potential security risk, as it allows command chaining if not properly sanitized.  
   - **Recommendation**: Pass the command and its arguments as a list to `subprocess.run()` to avoid relying on the shell interpreter.
